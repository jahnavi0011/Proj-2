Battleship

Purpose: COMP30020 Declarative Programming, Project 2

Note: All credit for the evaluation and other testing code goes to the COMP30020 faculty.

Proj2 is a two player guessing game similar to BattleShip, 
where the 'searcher' tries to locate three battleships hidden by 
the 'hider' across a 4x8 grid, and each grid location is identified by an
uppercase letter [A-H], followed by an integer [1-4]. 

The searcher makes a guess consisting of 3 distinct locations, 
and the three hidden ships must be located in a single guess. 
The objective is to find the exact locations using least number 
of guesses.
